		<h2>About</h2>
		<p id="blurb">
			Welcome to my site.  It's all about me, so I love it.  And hopefully you don't have too bad a time.  I am a Computer Scientist who graduated from Colorado School of Mines.  I am half Vietnamese and half Australian.  Recently, I've spent a large amount of my time thinking.  So much that I decided to start a <a href="https://abroomblog.wordpress.com" target="_blank">blog</a>.  And more of my eccentric behavior can be found <a href="#links">below</a>.

			To be completely honest, I have absolutely no idea where to begin.  However, I obviously had to choose something, and I chose to start with my parents.  My dad is responsible for the Australian in me.  He chose to go to college and finished with a PhD for Computer Science.  <i>Surprisingly, I had limited exposure to programming when I was young.  It wasn't until my "Intro to Computer Science" course in college when I made the switch from Mechanical Engineering to Computer Science.</i>  Dad met mum when he was an undergraduate, but nothing happened.  Mum, who was originally born in Vietnam and has an amazing life story, left to obtain her PhD in Statistics from Stanford Universtiy.  Afterwards, she returned to Australia, met my dad again, probably fell in love, got married, popped me out 5 or 10 years too early, moved from Canberra to Brisbane before I can remember, moved from Brisbane to Houston when I was 7, and waved goodbye when I moved to Colorado when I was 17.

			Thanks to my parents' hard work, I have had a very comfortable life.  Maybe a little too comfortable, I was an only child and terribly spoiled.  Luckily, I did not turn into a Brat <i>or so I've been told...</i> .  By the way, I personally recommend having a second child because I was rather lonely.  At the moment, I work as a software developer in Boulder.  And I live in Golden where I spend my spare time on too many activities.  Oh! My favorite presidents are Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and John Fitzgerald Kennedy.  So I'm a huge <i>or should I say "yuge".  I feel like "yuge" has run it's course.  I'm doing it anyway!</i> YUGE Bernie Sanders Supporter.
